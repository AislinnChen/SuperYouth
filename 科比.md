Dear Basketball,

亲爱的篮球，


From the moment I started rolling my dad’s tube socks，And shooting imaginary Game-winning shots In the Great Western Forum

从开始将老爸的筒袜卷成球状，并幻想在大西部论坛球馆打出绝杀球的那一刻。


I knew one thing was real: I fell in love with you. 

有一件事我知道是肯定的：我深深的爱上了你。


A love so deep I gave you my all — From my mind & body To my spirit & soul.

这份爱如此之深沉让我付出一切 - 从意识与身体、到精神与灵魂。


As a six-year-old boy Deeply in love with you，I never saw the end of the tunnel. 

作为一个深深爱着你的六岁小男孩，我从未见过这条隧道的尽头。


I only saw myself Running out of one. And so I ran. 

我只看见自己从一条隧道跑出，所以我开始奔跑。


I ran up and down every court After every loose ball for you. 

我开始在每场比赛夺球后拼命奔跑。


You asked for my hustle，I gave you my heart.

你要我拼尽全力，我连心都给你。


Because it came with so much more. 

因为这让我得到的远远更多。


I played through the sweat and hurt, Not because challenge called me，But because YOU called me. 

我一路打过来历经汗水与伤痛，不是因为挑战呼唤我，而是你在呼唤我。


I did everything for YOU. Because that’s what you do When someone makes you feel as Alive as you’ve made me feel. 

我为你倾尽所有，因为正是你让我找到自己存在的价值。


You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream，And I’ll always love you for it. 

你完成了一个六岁小孩儿的湖人梦，并且我会因此永远爱你。


But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer. 

但我无法在继续这份执着的爱了。


This season is all I have left to give. 

这个赛季是我最后所能付出的。


My heart can take the pounding，My mind can handle the grind，

我的心依然能承受重击，我的意志也能接受磨练，


But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye. 

但是我的身体告诉我，是时候说再见了。


And that’s OK. I’m ready to let you go. 

这也没关系。我准备好放手了。


I want you to know now So we both can savor every moment we have left together. 

我现在想告诉你，这样我们就能珍惜剩下的每一刻。


The good and the bad，We have given each other All that we have. 

无论是好还是坏，我们都已为对方倾尽所有。


And we both know, no matter what I do next，I’ll always be that kid With the rolled up socks

并且我们都知道，无论我接下来如何，我会始终是那个拿着袜子卷球的小孩儿。


Garbage can in the corner, 05 seconds on the clock. Ball in my hands.

垃圾桶就在角落，计时器就剩下五秒，球在我手中。


5 … 4 … 3 … 2 … 1


Love you always, Kobe

永远爱你的，科比
