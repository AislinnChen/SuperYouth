> 这份爱如此之深沉让我付出一切 - 从意识与身体、到精神与灵魂。


> As a six-year-old boy Deeply in love with you，I never saw the end of the tunnel.

>感谢你（指妻子）的陪伴、耐心，以及和我一样强的竞争心。你是我的终极队友。


>没有时间可以浪费。


> 科比如此成功，而且还将继续成就伟业，原因之一在于他对细节的高度重视。他总是跟我们说，如果你想成为更好的球员，就必须准备，准备，再准备，


> 有天赋是一回事，有动力去深究细微之处却是另一回事。


> 为了掌握新技能，必须大胆尝试，一旦能熟练应用，武器库就得以丰富。如果代价是大量工作和几次投丢，我没意见。


> 日益精进、成就伟大，这是我持之以恒的内在渴望，从不需要任何外部力量的刺激。


> 如果有些事情已经被其他伟大球员证明有效，而且对你同样有效，为什么要舍近求远，另辟蹊径？如果有效，就坚持到底，哪怕它不再流行。


> 不再关注看到的事物，转而观察本该出现却没出现的事物；不再关注发生了的事情，转而去思考本该发生却没能发生的事情。


> 与阅读同等重要的是，跟前几代伟大球员保持良好关系。


> 他们对我不吝赐教，帮我在竞争中脱颖而出。这就是找到导师如此重要的原因，他们有如北极星，你随时都能抬头仰望，得到指引。


> 想要精通某事，必须对它真正上心。想在某个领域出类拔萃，必须为之痴迷。很多人说他们渴望成就伟大，却不愿为此做出必要牺牲。他们关心的事太多，无论重要与否，都浪费了太多精力。


> 一个人追求伟大梦想，意味着很多人要为此付出无数努力。


> 对我来说，日常准备是不需要额外考虑的标准动作，从不为“做还是不做”犹豫不决。如果想把比赛打好，就非做不可，准时到场，直接去做。


> 只要我感到疲惫，就小睡一会儿。只需小憩15分钟，我就能补充足够能量，从而打出最高水平。


> 随着年岁渐长，我学会细心倾听身体的反馈，然后做出相应调整。


> 唯有付出大量努力，才能取得成功。人们会为你的成功大肆庆祝，各种包装和炒作接踵而至。然而，在这种包装炒作的背后，是奉献、专注和认真——局外人对此一无所见。如果你不再致力于提升技艺，广告和合同都会离你而去。


> 为什么还要自己投篮？他想传达这样的信息：想要赢得总冠军，必须让身边的人专注于各自最擅长的事情，而自己则专注于自己最擅长的事情。


> 彼此之间的尊重功不可没。


> 多和裁判沟通，对话必须坦诚，关系才会融洽。


> 当我年轻时，脑海里全都是“公众形象”“公众形象”“公众形象”，用各种套路来对待媒体。随着阅历增长，我开始意识到：不管怎样，都会有人喜欢你或不喜欢你，所以要做真实的自己。不管他们是否喜欢你，评判依据都应该是你真实的样子。从那时起，我开始开门见山，毫无保留，把自己的想法全都直截了当地表达出来。我也会在其中掺杂一些幽默和反讽。我认为球迷和记者逐渐接受了这一点，他们开始欣赏真实的我。


> 要不惜一切代价赢得胜利，至于失败，从来都不是我们可以接受的选项。


> “杀手心态”


> 在这些珍贵时刻，我会倾听一切细微的声音，全力吸收球馆里的所有能量。


> 本质上讲，我全力感受周围的能量，让它从我体内穿过。这种能量可以推动我打出伟大表现。


> 我喜欢挑战所有人，让他们感到不适。感到不适，才会自我省察，进而取得进步。你可以这么说，我喜欢推动人们去成为最好的自己。


> 我仍然会挑战所有人，让他们感到不适，但我会选择更适合他们本人的方式。为了了解哪些方式可能会对那些人有效，我开始私下做功课，观察他们的日常行为。我努力去了解他们有怎样的过去，倾听他们各自的目标是什么，什么能够给他们提供安全感，了解他们最大的疑惑在什么地方。一旦我真正理解了他们，我就能见机行事，在最合适的时机用最合适的方式去刺激他们的神经，以此激发出他们最好的自己。


> 如果你展现不出能与之媲美的激情，这些传奇巨星不会在你身边停留；如果你不能展现出与他们相匹配的不懈努力，以及那种追求卓越的上进心（一如他们当年），他们就不会与你分享自己的时间和记忆。


> 曼巴精神”是一种思维模式，它不在于寻求结果，而在于如何做才能取得结果，在于从现实到目标的这个过程。它是一段旅程、一种方法、一种生活方式。我真心认为，在所有努力之中，拥有这种心态最为重要。


> 我完全感受不到外界压力。我知道自己想要完成什么，以及要想实现这些目标，需要付出多少努力。于是我心无旁骛地投入工作，坚信它终将带来回报。此外，其他任何人对我的期望再怎么高，也高不过我对自己的期望。


> 最好的预判都来自经验积累，来自你对他们比赛套路的精心研究。如果功课做到位，你就知道他们在特定的位置喜欢做什么，从而提前做出判断，反客为主。


> 受伤之后，我想到的第一件事从来都是：“我该怎么做，才能回到百分之百的水平？”这就是我的心态，从不让任何恐惧或怀疑侵入我的心灵，既不牢骚满腹，也不怨天尤人。我是说，何必呢？


> 只要登上巅峰一次，你就想得到更多。

01:57
way you can we're cheering we're
01:58
watching that and we were we were super
02:00
excited you know
02:01
let's bring us back there because that
02:03
will lead us into what we're talking
02:04
about today because that's it's the
02:06
Mamba mentality that last game came out
02:08
of nowhere man yeah pretty much you know
02:12
it's uh for me it was just like the end
02:15
of a really long beautiful journey you
02:18
know I started playing a bad game
02:19
basketball I was too and so for this to
02:22
be deep moment this is deep last game
02:24
for me to come out and perform in front
02:26
of my fans in front of my home crowd
02:27
from my family
02:29
it was really exciting wasn't any
02:33
pressure wasn't sad or anything like
02:34
that it was like this is awesome you
02:37
know let's go out here and put on the
02:38
show one more time you've been doing
02:40
this for 20 years I'm sure you don't get
02:41
nervous were you nervous before this
02:43
game no I wasn't nervous
02:45
I was I was excited like I was ready to
02:47
go you know I was ready to go and you
02:49
know I saw my family right before we ran
02:52
out on the court and you know looked at
02:55
my wife and our kids and I just asked my
02:57
kids I see let's go put on the show one
02:59
more time is that okay they said yeah
03:01
yeah so when I put on the show first oh
03:03
it was fine it wasn't morning you
03:05
nervousness or anything like that
03:06
first shot didn't go in second shot
03:08
didn't go in yeah third shot didn't go
03:09
in yeah fourth fifth and six and then
03:12
all of a sudden buckets yeah well yeah
03:14
boom boom boom boom well I mean it makes
03:16
it it makes the journey worthwhile I
03:18
mean because you go through moments we
03:20
have that adversity and you got to
03:21
figure your way through it it's like the
03:23
start of the game I actually had this to
03:25
start laughing at myself after well I
03:26
got after I missed like the fifth shot
03:28
in a row so this is pretty funny this
03:30
game can either be like I can either
03:32
turn it around or this is gonna be
03:34
absolutely horrendous
03:36
be the worst last game ever so you know
03:39
from that point I said I'm comfortable
03:41
it's either gonna be the worst last game
03:42
ever it's gonna be the best last game
03:44
ever but I don't want anything in
03:45
between so that leads me to ask because
03:48
that last game you've been doing
03:50
something you've been doing since you
03:52
were four five years old it's not about
03:55
the physical because you've done this a
03:56
million times you've practiced the left
03:58
hand pull-up mid-range the right hand
04:00
pull-up mid-range to step back the pivot
04:02
the reverse pivot you know going at
04:04
attacking different angles you've been
04:05
doing that so it's not about
04:06
physicalness because that's all in green
04:08
was that last game fully just mental
04:10
just fighting through it and just say
04:12
look I got it I got do this yeah it was
04:15
no cuz I was I was ready to play I was
04:17
excited to play you know once the game
04:19
started it became became the norm you
04:23
know it became reading defensive
04:25
situations you know positioning of my
04:28
teammates and you know just overall
04:30
strategy and tactics and it felt good to
04:32
get back to that you know because that's
04:34
the part of the game that I enjoyed the
04:36
most
04:36
the mindfulness at that game yeah the
04:38
fun of it's like a puzzle you have to
04:40
figure out what pieces go where
04:42
and that's the enjoyment in the game I
04:46
think that's what we're we're leading
04:47
here today in our TEDx talk is uh the
04:50
power of the mind and I think because
04:52
you know there's been so many athletes
04:54
that have made the NBA the highest
04:56
echelon of professional basketball in
04:58
the world and there's athletes that can
05:00
jump as high as the sky but as fast as
05:03
you know a cheetah they get hit buckets
05:06
they can react and react but it's it's
05:08
the special nature players that have
05:10
that mindfulness that have that
05:12
attacking mode that relentless mode that
05:14
mode where they go ice-cold last few
05:16
minutes you know I think I think that
05:19
makes a difference between the great
05:21
ones in the greatest ones right yeah you
05:24
know it's it's funny like it's to me the
05:26
mentality is a really simple one in an
05:29
assistant the confidence comes from
05:31
preparation you know so when the games
05:34
on a lot I'm not asking myself to do
05:36
something that I haven't done thousands
05:38
of times before right so when I prepare
05:41
I know what I'm capable of doing I know
05:43
what I'm comfortable doing and I know
05:44
what I'm not comfortable doing right and
05:47
so in those moments if it looks like ice
05:49
cold or not nervous it's because I've
05:52
done it thousands of times before so
05:54
it's one more time so that leads me to
05:57
talk about a lot of this Kobe tour this
06:00
year in Asia is we we reiterate the
06:03
Mamba mentality you know can you talk a
06:05
little bit about what the Mamba
06:07
mentality is because that's something
06:09
that's been developing over I don't say
06:12
20 years it's been developing for 35
06:15
years since you were a little kid that
06:16
Mamba mentality because you didn't start
06:18
working when you got to the NBA you
06:20
started working when you are at Lower
06:22
Merion when you were in Italy when you
06:23
were five when you're playing nerf nerf
06:25
basketball so talking I'll talk about
06:27
the development of the Mamba mentality
06:30
the pillars the five pillars of this
06:32
Mamba mentality and then we'll kind of
06:34
break it down well I mean I overall you
06:36
know the idea is a very simple one and
06:38
you know the mama mentality simply means
06:41
trying to be the best version of
06:43
yourself that's what the mentality means
06:46
it means everyday you know you're trying
06:48
to become better it's a constant quest
06:51
it's an infinite quest so starting at
06:54
the age of two when I
06:55
start playing the game and on and on and
06:57
on I always ask questions I always tried
06:59
to get better every single day learn
07:01
more you were asking questions at - oh
07:03
dude I was you'd be surprised like some
07:06
people like my kids had to could do a
07:08
lot of things mm-hmm right I - I could
07:11
dribble the basketball I could shoot a
07:13
basketball on the nerf hoop at the house
07:15
and I would go to practice with my
07:16
father I would observe my father I'd sit
07:20
and watch games with him see her first
07:22
coach yeah I guess you could say that
07:24
you know a lot of things I learned by
07:26
being just being around the game right
07:28
so by the age of six I was already
07:30
strategizing versus other six-year-olds
07:33
you know the age of six I figured out
07:35
six-year-olds couldn't dribble with
07:37
their left hand so I said okay a lot of
07:39
a lot of 12 year olds can't dribble with
07:41
her well yeah it would imagine six so
07:42
like I was playing these six year old
07:44
kids I would make them dribble with
07:46
their left because I knew they couldn't
07:47
so they dribble off their foot I pick it
07:50
up lay it up do it again dribble off
07:52
foot pick it up laid up says say shoes
07:54
oh it had 63 points mm I'd say you're
08:00
sick so your six-year-old self could
08:02
beat your 38 year old selfies you only
08:04
scored 60 in the last game yeah no but I
08:06
could remove my left oh so that's a
08:07
problem but um but yeah listen I I just
08:11
constantly looked for things to learn
08:14
from and very observant okay so when we
08:18
talk about the mama mentality you have
08:21
your exhibition today starting in
08:22
Shanghai right also we've been talking
08:25
about this whole tour with young kids
08:27
that are 5 10 15 20 we've been we just
08:31
did a Kobe Academy right now we talk
08:32
about being passionate being obsessive
08:35
being relentless being resilient and
08:38
being fearless these are the five
08:41
pillars of the mama mentality so we'll
08:43
kind of break that down today sure the
08:45
first one is just be passionate you know
08:47
what what is that is there is there is
08:49
there a moment where you can define your
08:51
passion for the game or was it just
08:53
something accumulated over time well I
08:55
mean you know the passion came from the
08:57
love for the game you know I loved
08:59
everything about it like the smell of
09:00
the ball you love the smell of the ball
09:02
the ball you know the smell of like
09:05
brand-new sneakers
09:06
you like the sound the ball meets when
09:07
it hits the ground sneakers in the gym
09:09
did you did yeah the ball going through
09:12
the net like all those things I love and
09:15
so the passion comes from that because
09:16
once you have that love you just want to
09:18
be a part of this thing all the time
09:21
when you when you talk about this love
09:23
when does that develop were you did you
09:26
like it when you were five or is it
09:28
something that kind of gradually was - I
09:30
was born and I was born to play
09:32
basketball you know what I mean and I
09:34
played a lot of different sports but
09:36
nothing brought me the sense of peace
09:41
escape you know that the game of
09:44
basketball do is it an escape when you
09:46
get on the court is that your Zen time
09:48
your your your solitude time yeah even
09:50
though it's a team working yeah when I
09:51
need that escape is there for me right
09:53
when I need a friend it's there for me
09:55
and when I need to vent and don't donkey
09:57
the mama come this there you know so
09:59
yeah the game is absolutely everything
10:01
for me mm-hmm when you when we talk
10:05
about trying to get kids to be
10:07
passionate I don't think every kid I
10:09
don't think your situation is the norm
10:11
not every kid is knows they're
10:14
passionate two or five right how do kids
10:17
find that passion because you know you
10:21
you you embraced it right away yeah any
10:23
experience we try to put them in
10:25
different things try to expose them to
10:26
as many things as possible and then see
10:29
if there's one thing that connects with
10:30
them because if it does you don't have
10:33
to tell them to do it you know whether
10:35
it's writing or painting or drawing you
10:37
know if they have that passion you don't
10:40
have to tell them they're go off and do
10:41
it because it's just fun you'd rather do
10:43
that than anything else so but as
10:45
parents it's our job to just expose them
10:47
so as many things as possible and see
10:48
which one they gravitate to the most
10:50
it's interesting because you talk about
10:52
kids right originally we're talking
10:54
about you now you're talking about your
10:55
kids and their passions do you do you
10:58
kind of feel that passion for them and
10:59
then say hey let's go play some
11:00
basketball or volleyball or let's go
11:03
swimming
11:03
yeah we exposing all kinds that maybe
11:05
they play a lot of different sports they
11:07
do a lot of things creatively you know
11:08
in writing and things like that and
11:09
designing and you just sit back and you
11:13
just watch which one they move to and
11:14
then it's our responsibility as parents
11:16
try to set them up for success as much
11:18
as we possibly can do you want them to
11:20
play basketball I wanted to find
11:22
whatever it is that they're passionate
11:24
about like whatever they feel like their
11:25
purpose is and that's what I want them
11:26
to do do they love basketball that's
11:28
prom so I my youngest one she does she
11:32
wants to she wants to play she wants me
11:34
to teach how to play this summer and you
11:36
know our hell this is really into
11:37
volleyball so and but we'll see you know
11:40
how passions tend to change is he gonna
11:42
get into volleyball now
11:43
well yeah sister was a great volleyball
11:47
player so you have a teacher in the
11:49
family is there is there one moment
11:51
where you can say it defined your
11:53
passion for basketball is there a story
11:55
or moment when you said that wasn't it
11:57
that was it that was like when I felt
11:58
really passionate no I
12:01
it doesn't never leave you know the game
12:05
was just a part of me so it never leaves
12:09
even now that I'm retired you know
12:11
everything I've learned from the game of
12:13
basketball I've carried it over into
12:14
life you know like basketballs helped me
12:17
be a better person a better friend but
12:18
how solid well because there's life
12:20
lessons that are within the game like
12:22
communications like unselfishness
12:25
attention to detail and empathy and
12:29
compassion like all those things are in
12:31
the game and as an athlete if we are
12:34
aware of those things it helps us become
12:37
better human human beings and you can
12:40
apply that toward your post post
12:43
basketball days retirement into your
12:46
business world future ventures sure I
12:48
mean you can plan you know I was
12:49
applying that even while I was playing
12:52
just in life outside of the game and
12:54
even more so now you know I'm building a
12:56
business and all these things you know
12:58
kind of culture you when I have all
13:01
those things are or directly learn from
13:06
the game of basketball next up is the
13:09
next pillar be obsessive obsessive
13:13
that's I think I think a lot of people
13:15
equate that with you you know Kobe is
13:17
obsessive in a lot of things we've been
13:20
doing this for what eight years now at
13:22
Asia tour you know I've been with you
13:24
for a long way the one moment that
13:26
stands out out of we've done I don't
13:29
know how many
13:29
we've done what 800 events the one time
13:32
was 4 a.m. we went up to practice at 4
13:35
a.m. and that was your idea to do it but
13:38
then you know all these Nike people are
13:40
like no no no let's not let's not do
13:41
that and then you're like let's do it at
13:43
4 a.m. so you got security
13:44
you got brand marketing sports marketing
13:46
go no no no no no no let's not do it
13:48
you're like let's do it because that's
13:49
your sustenance I mean to me it just
13:52
makes complete sense not to us see we
13:57
all right what you usually I'm sleeping
14:00
at 4 a.m. you're here working out so
14:02
talk about that ok
14:04
so if if your job is to try to be the
14:07
best basketball player you can be right
14:09
to do that you have to practice you have
14:11
to train right you want to train as much
14:13
as you can as often as you can so if you
14:17
get up at 10:00 in the morning
14:18
train at 11:00 12:00 say 12:00 train at
14:22
12:00 train for two hours 12:00 to 2:00
14:24
you have to let your body recover so you
14:26
eat recover whatever you get back out
14:28
you train start training it at 6:00
14:30
train from 6:00 to 8:00 right and now
14:33
you go home and shower you dinner you go
14:35
to bed you wake up do it again right
14:37
those are two sessions all right now
14:38
imagine you wake up at 3 you train at 4
14:40
go 4 to 6 come home
14:42
breakfast relax so so now you're back at
14:45
it again 9 to 11 relax and now just on
14:49
your back at it again to the 4 and have
14:52
you're back at it again you know 7 to 9
14:54
look how much more training I have done
14:57
by simply starting at 4 all right so now
15:00
you do that and as the years go on the
15:03
separation that you have with your
15:05
competitors and your peers just grows
15:07
larger and larger and larger and larger
15:09
and larger and by year five or six
15:11
doesn't matter what kind of work they
15:13
doing a summer they're never going to
15:15
catch up because they're five years
15:17
behind so it makes sense to get up and
15:20
start your day early because you can get
15:22
more work out is that genetic or is that
15:25
something you you engrained and trained
15:26
yourself no it was taught you that for
15:28
me it was it was just common sense like
15:29
I can I can if I start earlier I can
15:32
train more hours and I know the other
15:34
guys aren't doing it because I know what
15:35
their training schedule is so I know if
15:38
I do this consistently over time it's
15:41
the gaps is gonna why
15:43
why no why no why no why and they won't
15:45
be able to get that back mm-hmm
15:47
so it's me it was just common sense I'm
15:48
like thinking how can I get an advantage
15:50
Oh start earlier yeah let's do that when
15:52
did you start doing that high school
15:57
high school we start my first class on
15:59
high school was seven at 7:45 I usually
16:02
get to the gym around 5:00 a.m. and I'd
16:04
play before school mmm and then school
16:07
with stars and playing with you at 5:00
16:08
a.m. my coach my coach would show up and
16:10
we'd do all these basketball drills so
16:12
just you and your coach just me and my
16:13
coach and sometimes it would just be me
16:15
and a janitor who's still there today
16:19
and and then I play at lunch I guess you
16:22
get a medal III hooked him up with a few
16:25
things but I play going lunch and then
16:29
practice after and then go home do my
16:32
schoolwork and then watch a bunch of
16:34
game film and games on TV and study
16:36
study film was that the only thing
16:39
you've been obsessed about basketball
16:40
well until recently yeah so recently
16:43
yeah basketball is dominated you know my
16:46
my entire life more than 30 years what
16:50
when when I when I brought it up like
16:52
what are you is a genetic or you just
16:54
learned it I mean how did that idea even
16:57
come up because that's obviously a
16:59
pillar of mama mentality the
17:01
obsessiveness this is just like you said
17:02
I'm gonna get up at 4:00 and everybody's
17:04
get up at 6:00 if everybody's gonna get
17:06
that for I'm gonna get up at 2:00 right
17:08
right how do you how do you develop that
17:10
or what do you what do you learn that
17:12
from well I think it's just no it's just
17:15
a matter of what's important to you
17:17
mm-hmm
17:18
what's important to you for whatever
17:19
reason you know I felt like I didn't
17:24
feel good about myself if I wasn't doing
17:27
everything I could to be the best
17:29
version of myself if I felt like I left
17:32
anything on the table it would eat away
17:35
at me I wouldn't be able to look myself
17:36
in the mirror right so the reason why I
17:39
can retire now and be completely
17:40
comfortable about it because I know that
17:42
I've done everything I could to be the
17:45
best basketball player I could be
17:47
and so that's where it comes from for me
17:50
you can't leave any stone unturned
17:51
because you know we do all these events
17:53
and like today we just did one you guys
17:57
weren't here we were just at the Colby
17:58
Academy we just had all these kids 24
18:01
best high school basketball players in
18:03
China running playing basketball running
18:06
five on five running all these drills
18:08
and then at the end we had this little
18:09
game where all they had to do was run
18:12
this drill called Seventeen's
18:14
Seventeen's is really simple one minute
18:16
you got to run 17 times from from
18:18
sideline to sideline it's tough it's
18:21
tough you got to run it in one minute if
18:23
any of you've been playing basketball in
18:24
high school you know what I mean it's a
18:26
killer it's all it is is just grit it's
18:29
just let's just run and then this kid
18:32
you know we're running and this is poor
18:34
media we got the media on the side and
18:35
and if they ran to get a pair of Kobe
18:37
shoes so you know it's for fun
18:39
when I warned them and he award them I
18:42
said if you guys run the 17 everybody
18:45
gets a pair of shoes if you don't touch
18:49
the line you get nothing
18:51
so they buddy touched the line so this
18:54
is where Kobe gets his obsessiveness so
18:56
we're sitting there everybody's kind of
18:57
happy we're thinking that they're gonna
18:58
run the lines when I have a presentation
19:00
for the shoes the kids are running
19:02
they've been running for two hours run
19:04
and run and running this one kid misses
19:08
the line by like half-inch no wasn't
19:11
even half inch that much he misses the
19:16
line Kobe's like stop stop stop stop
19:18
stop we had to stop we had to stop
19:20
everything and he's like nobody gets
19:22
shoes and all these kids are like oh
19:25
they're mad at the kid yeah and you know
19:34
he's like nobody nobody gets shoes you
19:35
guys sit on the sidelines and then Kobe
19:36
made this kid run suicides which is
19:40
another drill baseline free-throw line
19:42
baseline half court baseline opposite
19:45
free-throw line baseline baseline and
19:46
back three in a row three times you had
19:50
to run three of them
19:51
yeah but the best part was the best part
19:54
was the last one
19:56
Kobe ran with this kid he ran with this
19:59
kid
20:00
okay yeah it's awesome ran with this kid
20:04
and there's a meal 1.1 million people
20:07
are watching online crazy he were on
20:09
with this kid this kid was dry-heaving
20:11
he was about to die yeah but you're
20:14
lucky he did die noise it was he was a
20:17
good time but but the important thing
20:19
understand is you can't you can't
20:21
shortchange yourself like yeah you're
20:24
not cheating anybody but yourself I mean
20:27
you're tired you're literally this far
20:28
away from the line why would you not go
20:30
that extra to touch the line alright so
20:33
if I let him get away with that right
20:35
all of a sudden he starts maybe you
20:37
cheat something over here right and I
20:38
give his best over here
20:40
I give his best over here and as years
20:42
go on he's gonna be extremely he's not
20:44
gonna reach his full potential because
20:46
he's been taking these little shortcuts
20:48
that just add up add up add up add up
20:50
and you can't let that happen
20:52
our job as teachers as mentors as
20:54
inspirers it's our responsibility to
20:56
hold them accountable to those things
20:59
the funny part is we were we're just
21:02
talking about this kid we're in the back
21:03
and Kobes like I bet you that kid will
21:06
never ever miss the line again because
21:13
that what no where so that that's you
21:16
being obsessive but teaching
21:17
obsessiveness because that's that's what
21:19
you gotta be right do you you have to be
21:21
obsessive to get to that level in
21:23
everything you do details don't waste
21:25
time do it right perfection yeah I mean
21:27
it's this really simple is like whatever
21:30
you're doing at that moment is what
21:32
you're doing at that moment you know
21:34
it's like that's where the obsessiveness
21:37
is having of attention to detail for
21:38
this action that you are performing at
21:40
the time you're performing it and if you
21:42
can have that kind of focus you can't
21:44
help but to have a certain level of
21:46
obsession or attention to detail moving
21:50
on to the the third pillar is to be real
21:52
relentless that we know you for you know
21:55
we see you on TV being relentless first
21:59
quarter second quarter third quarter
22:00
fourth quarter attack attack attack
22:03
never letting your teammates slack off
22:06
attack attack attack wait how do you get
22:08
that talk about what is what is the
22:10
meaning of relentlessness to you
22:12
well is to never to be unyielding never
22:17
give an inch to any really like you're
22:18
always going after it always going after
22:21
always going after it and if there's a
22:22
challenge that ensues oh good I want to
22:25
see how I stack up to that so you go
22:26
after you go after it and it's just so
22:29
it's fun it's like you get a chance to
22:31
compete against opponents and you get a
22:33
chance to see where you stack up against
22:36
them saying I want to see it maybe I'm
22:38
not good enough today with that that's
22:40
fine
22:40
I'll be good enough the next time I see
22:42
you though you know and you get a chance
22:44
to always measure yourself and it's it's
22:48
just fun to do that so I guess that's
22:50
where relentlessness comes from it's is
22:52
it something that's also learned or
22:55
ingrained or is it something you kind of
22:56
learn over time because these things
22:59
that we talk about new mom mentality you
23:01
know for you it's second nature mm-hmm
23:05
it's not for a lot of people right a lot
23:08
of it is is trained or it's not
23:10
god-given no I I had to learn it as well
23:13
though cuz I'm at had a year of playing
23:16
like when I play basketball in Italy I
23:18
was taller than everybody else and
23:20
faster like the age of 11 and I came
23:24
back to America to play basketball and
23:26
it was not the same thing because kids
23:28
were bigger stronger and so I went
23:30
through a summer of playing basketball
23:31
in America where I didn't score one
23:33
point it was one league I didn't score
23:35
one point and it was devastating but I
23:39
had to know I'm not giving up it's not
23:41
going to happen so you bounce back and
23:43
you keep playing you keep practicing you
23:44
keep practicing but I mean it wasn't
23:46
handed to me you didn't score one point
23:48
not one I mean not even a free-throw and
23:50
your zero you were how old 11 11 will
23:53
you playing against 25 year olds no I
23:54
was playing against 11 it's hard to
23:58
believe
23:58
wow I know I know but else playing
24:00
against 11 year olds and I didn't score
24:02
one point and then what was that did
24:05
that uh did I hurt you or you were you
24:07
well yeah it was very embarrassing
24:09
because you know my father was a
24:10
Philadelphia basketball legend my uncle
24:12
was a Philadelphia basketball legend and
24:14
now here I am this kid like these really
24:16
big knee pads and I'm walking around and
24:19
I can't score anything so I was like
24:21
really embarrassing that drove you of
24:25
course it did
24:26
corseted I vowed to be much much better
24:28
so you live for those moments where
24:30
you're embarrassed when you're down
24:32
people kick you don't let you score
24:33
those are the moments that drive you
24:35
well I mean those are the moments that
24:36
occur right so whatever moments occur
24:38
good bad or indifferent I can use those
24:40
moments to propel me forward use those
24:43
as fuel to help me be a better player is
24:47
there a moment in your MBA career where
24:48
you felt like you didn't hit that mark
24:52
and that was a huge transition for you
24:54
yeah I always felt like I missed the
24:56
marks in the league what were some of
25:00
the down moments for you in basketball
25:02
well losing to the Celtics in the
25:03
financial 2008 I mean that was tough
25:05
that hurt me too yeah it was brutal and
25:08
and aw yeah night in the hotel room
25:11
after we lost was thinking to myself I
25:13
may never win another championship like
25:15
I might have just like this is it it's
25:18
too hard to get back here maybe it's not
25:20
in the cards to win another one and so I
25:22
go through that night of being mad and
25:24
then the next morning I wake up and I
25:25
start thinking no I gotta fix this so
25:29
where did it go wrong you know why did
25:32
we lose we weren't tough enough
25:34
okay weren't tough enough whose
25:35
responsibility is that to make the team
25:37
tough it's mine so now I have to start
25:39
figuring out how I'm gonna lead this
25:41
team differently so to make sure that
25:43
when we get to the finals the next time
25:44
we were tough and ready for this
25:46
challenge and that's that's how you
25:50
bounce back from those moments that was
25:52
2008 2008 2008 against the Celtics and I
25:56
mean all of Laker nation was hurt
25:58
because especially because it was
25:59
against the Celtics
26:00
right it was painful you can't lose
26:03
Celtics come on because also that was
26:09
there that was there like 17 right yeah
26:11
for their for their organization yeah
26:15
and then you bounce back the next year
26:18
against Orlando Orlando got our revenge
26:22
against the Celtics in 2000 it did
26:24
beating the Celtics feel better than
26:26
beating Orlando oh yeah oh yeah yes yeah
26:31
yeah man I grew up such a Lakers fan and
26:34
so like the Lakers and Celtics Ryan just
26:36
hate on everything yeah but you hate up
26:37
we can't
26:38
no way I can be on the team when a
26:40
Lakers team that loses to the Celtics
26:42
twice no you know it's funny because in
26:47
in Asia me being here in Asia too a lot
26:50
of a lot of fans are fans of a player
26:53
and they they love that player and
26:56
subsequently late they loved that team
26:58
that their player plays for but growing
27:01
up in the States if you grew up in
27:03
Philly you were a Sixers fan right and
27:05
then if you grew up in LA you were a
27:07
Lakers fan you are also a Dodgers fan
27:09
and at the time you are a Rams fan you
27:12
you affiliated with your city and then
27:14
the city that you hate it was your arch
27:17
enemy so you if you're a Laker fan you
27:19
just hate the Celtics and you hate every
27:21
team every team that that loses them you
27:25
root for every team against the Celtic
27:26
no question yeah the enemy of my enemy
27:29
is my friend you just want to see them
27:30
do bad yeah just do bad if you if you
27:33
are a Dodger fan you just want to see
27:34
the Giants lit so right it's not
27:36
necessarily good karma but yeah it's not
27:38
but when you lost to the Celtics and you
27:40
beat him again that moment that that's
27:43
relentless because you come coming back
27:45
coming back coming back and you you had
27:46
to come back and beat their court can't
27:48
give up and then desert is it was that
27:51
up was that a big moment for you beating
27:53
beating the Celtics it was huge you know
27:55
because you know we seen I've seen us as
27:58
a team grow so much from 2008 Pao Lamar
28:03
you know all our guys like how much we
28:05
have grown since the last time we faced
28:08
this team and I couldn't be any more
28:11
proud of them
28:12
you know it wasn't even about me it was
28:14
about sitting back and watching us as a
28:16
group and we just accomplished this
28:18
amazing thing and now we can all enjoy
28:21
it together so moving on to the next
28:24
pillar is to be resilient I remember
28:27
this time last year you came and we did
28:31
a premiere for a movie you did music and
28:34
a big big part of that movie was talking
28:37
about your injury and coming back to be
28:39
resilient take us back to that day
28:42
against uh Phoenix right when you
28:44
injured your Achilles is golden stage it
28:46
was it was it was hard man
28:48
because the Achilles injury
28:50
is the worst injury for an athlete it's
28:53
like the works it's like the the kiss of
28:55
death and when I ruptured my Achilles
28:58
eye I knew what happened I knew the
29:00
severity of the injury and I didn't know
29:02
if I was gonna come back from it yeah in
29:04
the locker room you were crying yeah
29:06
this is it like my career could be over
29:09
right now so how do you get back from
29:10
that because you know when you talk
29:12
about injuries
29:13
you know people sprained their ankles
29:15
just look at your fingers but Achilles
29:18
yeah you know people don't come back
29:20
from that well athletes don't come back
29:21
from that to the level they were before
29:24
yeah how is to how do you get that
29:27
resilience how do you fight that well
29:29
what I did is you know I went home and I
29:31
was just really angry and angry I was
29:34
angry I was mad and I worked so hard for
29:36
us to get to the playoffs and to have a
29:38
chance to another championship and this
29:40
happened so I had a lot of anger and
29:42
then from the anger and then I was sad
29:44
and then you start feeling bad for
29:46
yourself and then you say alright okay
29:50
I'm done being a baby okay what am I
29:53
gonna do now because I can't sit here
29:56
and give up that's not an option
29:57
so now what how long was this cycle from
30:00
this angers one night one night this is
30:02
one night one night who's you you
30:04
started writing in the middle right you
30:07
wrote that uh you-you-you wrote that it
30:09
was okay what are you gonna do so yeah
30:12
one night but then you know didn't you
30:15
start it's a process you look at process
30:17
what am I gonna do what can I control
30:19
surgery will do the surgery come out of
30:22
the surgery recover from their physical
30:26
therapy okay
30:27
physical therapy piece by piece by piece
30:29
by piece by piece
30:30
start running back on the court it's our
30:33
broke things down into sections and said
30:35
okay I'm gonna focus on resting right
30:37
now this is it I'm gonna focus on moving
30:40
my toes and then walking and then so you
30:43
look at every challenge at every step
30:45
and that's how you're able to be
30:49
resilient and come back from these
30:50
things because you know for your field
30:54
in in sports injuries often happen right
30:58
and to come back but you know for for
31:01
most everyday people it's
31:03
it's something that they can't fathom
31:04
because they don't they don't have that
31:06
type of Raziel resistance that they have
31:09
to face right so how do they how do they
31:11
come back from it because sometimes
31:12
people fail in their fields and their
31:14
jobs or at school young kids you know
31:16
you don't have a good test score you
31:18
don't make the basketball team or you
31:19
know they have these disappointments how
31:21
do they what is your advice to young
31:22
kids to you know to to face the faceless
31:26
adversity how do you persevere well like
31:29
if you because you you have that
31:31
chemical makeup to fight through it yeah
31:33
not all kids do but but you you every
31:37
kid every person has the ability to put
31:39
one foot in front of the other one step
31:40
at a time right so like if you're saying
31:42
okay I'm gonna climb Mount Everest at
31:45
the bottom of the mountain and you look
31:46
up you're going right but if you break
31:50
it down into sections and you just one
31:53
foot in front of the other one step at a
31:55
time
31:55
next thing you know you're at the top of
31:57
the mountain so the the map the the plan
32:02
is to set short-term goals yeah to get
32:05
there eight to be coming back from my
32:09
Achilles I came back from the Achilles
32:11
and I was fine and then the next year I
32:13
fractured my knee mm-hmm right here we
32:16
go again come back from that next year
32:18
tear my shoulder if we go again right
32:21
but if I looked at those things in
32:22
totality to be depressing but if I look
32:26
at it as just the facts this is this is
32:29
it happened can't do anything about it
32:30
it happened now what are you gonna do
32:32
one step at a time
32:34
Achilles knee shoulder any step of the
32:37
way you said screw it forget it
32:39
done no more no never no well no but why
32:44
right because you know as time goes on
32:47
and sitting there 78 years old and I'm
32:52
gonna be wondering if I could have come
32:54
back from this injury I don't want to
32:55
wonder I want to find out we got to get
32:57
to destiny I want to see man we got into
32:59
that game yeah the critics are out there
33:01
saying he's done he'll never come back
33:03
well maybe you're right
33:05
maybe you're not but let's find out we
33:08
got to get there we gotta get there last
33:11
one to be fearless you know that's
33:13
that's something that uh I think every
33:15
young adult you
33:17
kids they face their fears right what is
33:20
what does that mean to be to be fearless
33:21
why is that such an important part of
33:24
the Mamba mentality well max I think the
33:26
greatest fear that we face is ourselves
33:28
actually you know I think it's uh it's
33:31
not anything that's external or anything
33:33
that's superficial I think the greatest
33:35
fear you face is yourself because you
33:37
know we all have dreams and it's very
33:40
scary sometimes to accept the dream that
33:43
you have and it's scarier still to say
33:45
okay I want that it's scary because
33:48
you're afraid that if you put your heart
33:50
and soul into it and you fail then how
33:53
are you gonna feel about yourself right
33:55
so being fearless means putting yourself
33:57
out there and going for it no matter
34:00
what go for it
34:02
not for anybody else but for yourself
34:06
when you when you when you got to the
34:07
league you're 18 did you have any fears
34:10
before getting there or when you got
34:12
there right away yeah I mean you know I
34:14
had fears that everybody was gonna be
34:16
right I made a poor choice poor decision
34:19
jump from I was too you know wasn't
34:22
gonna mount anything so that was always
34:24
in the back of my mind for sure mm-hmm
34:26
and then so out of these five pillars
34:31
which one do you think comes first be
34:34
passionate be fearless relentless
34:35
resilient or they just come together
34:38
I'll know I this funny thing is like we
34:40
created these separate pillars but the
34:43
reality is it's all one thing you know
34:45
because it all comes from within all
34:47
comes from within us we all experience
34:49
these things at different stages in
34:50
different points different times the key
34:53
I feel is just to be aware of those
34:55
moments as they occur but you're aware
34:57
of a certain fear or a certain obstacle
35:02
or challenge right you're just aware of
35:03
those things and then from there you can
35:04
navigate through them but I look more I
35:07
look at them all as one one connecting
35:12
thing because I think being fearless
35:15
this last one sticks out in my mind a
35:18
lot because you know being in Asia Asian
35:21
kids a lot of times they're a little bit
35:25
more boxed in in in thought and
35:28
mentality as opposed to Western kids
35:31
Western kids the lot of the family the
35:33
environment you know ever since a young
35:35
age in school it's it's preaching
35:36
independence speak your thoughts be
35:38
creative independent you know a lot of
35:40
that you know it's in it's in it's it's
35:42
also reiterated by teachers principals
35:45
mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles
35:48
and coaches is to to bring name to
35:51
yourself and to be independent to be out
35:52
there and go on your own but in in
35:54
Eastern in Asia a lot of the cultures
35:57
whether it's Chinese Japanese Korean
35:58
it's you know don't go out there and do
36:01
crazy things don't go out of your
36:03
comfort zone
36:03
bring make your family proud you know
36:06
don't don't bring other people attention
36:08
just do your thing do it well but don't
36:10
bring attention you know it's and I
36:12
think a lot of kids are fearful of going
36:14
out of this box right
36:17
is there a vice for these kids because a
36:19
lot of times it's a cultural difference
36:20
sure right you know how did how do they
36:23
put themselves out there waiting listen
36:25
it's very so you have to dance
36:28
beautifully in the box that you are
36:30
comfortable dancing in right so like
36:33
everybody's box is different my box was
36:37
to be extremely ambitious within the
36:38
sport of basketball your box it's
36:41
different than mine right every kid here
36:43
has their own box but doesn't mean that
36:44
your box isn't as beautiful as mine
36:46
right everybody has their own is your
36:50
job to try to perfect it and make it as
36:52
beautiful of a canvas as you can make it
36:55
and if you have done that then you have
36:56
lived the successful life you have lived
36:58
with Mambo mentality right so it doesn't
37:01
mean you have to go out here and do all
37:02
of these crazy things I'll have to be
37:03
like this person or that person no what
37:06
are you comfortable being what it is
37:07
that wit what is it that you want to do
37:09
with your life and once you have that
37:11
then you try to live it to the best of
37:12
your abilities so you know growing up in
37:16
Italy and then moving on to Philadelphia
37:19
and then to LA you know obviously you
37:22
talked about this box right so is that
37:25
box constantly changing are you trying
37:28
to get out of your comfort zone even
37:30
when you were you know first for the NBA
37:33
and then tenth year in the NBA and then
37:35
even this year there's that box that
37:37
this metaphorical box you talk about
37:38
does that change no I never tried I've
37:40
never looked at it as like I'm just
37:41
gonna you know
37:43
try something completely crazy or like
37:46
just just go out on my box with a thing
37:48
I just looked at it as I want to be one
37:52
of the best basketball players who have
37:53
ever played that's the end goal okay how
37:56
do I get there how do I get there and
37:58
every decision I made in my life was
38:00
centered around the process of helping
38:03
me eventually get there you know them
38:06
saying so I had that purpose and once I
38:08
had that purpose every decision that I
38:10
made was centered around that purpose
38:11
you think you got there looking back
38:14
upon it now two decades in the NBA you
38:17
know high school it'll lead to high
38:20
school and Philadelphia to the NBA you
38:22
spent your whole career with one
38:24
organization to me is that your biggest
38:27
accomplishment to be with one team thank
38:30
you you look back upon it now when you
38:34
had your goals as a kid you're five
38:36
years old you want to be in the NBA and
38:37
then when you're at lower merion in
38:39
Philadelphia and those dreams started to
38:41
become a I'm gonna get there right and
38:43
then you're in the NBA you set goals for
38:45
yourself you talked about all time when
38:47
you're young in the NBA you set personal
38:49
achievement goals I'm gonna win a game
38:50
I'm gonna win a championship I'm gonna
38:52
win the MVP I'm gonna win this I'm gonna
38:54
win that and then later on you changed
38:56
because you said I'm just gonna get
38:58
better and when I if I'm gonna get a
39:00
better left hand I'm gonna have a better
39:01
three-point I'm gonna have a better free
39:03
throw those other personal achievements
39:04
come naturally mm-hmm now you're done
39:06
mm-hmm like your final game 60 points
39:08
you dropped it on Utah Mamba out right
39:11
yeah you look back upon it now where do
39:15
you see yourself did you did you do
39:16
everything you wanted to do did you
39:18
become the best best basa player you can
39:21
ever become if you become the best it's
39:23
so it's weird like I did my vision of
39:28
what my goal is changed drastically as I
39:31
got older it's like as a kid I said I
39:33
want to be the best ever right and now
39:35
you go through your life and everything
39:37
you do is trying to be the best I would
39:38
be your best ever be the best ever and
39:39
as you get older you start understanding
39:40
that those things are very superficial
39:42
things and everybody has a different
39:44
opinion about it no matter what you do I
39:46
can win 20 championships there's always
39:48
an opinion on who's the best everybody
39:50
has different opinions and so I started
39:52
really kind of understanding maybe it's
39:53
not
39:54
the important thing maybe the important
39:56
thing is to you know how do we as a team
39:59
grow how do I help my teammates be
40:02
better so that was the first change for
40:05
me and then as I got older still it
40:08
became more about how are you inspiring
40:11
others right to find themselves that is
40:15
the ultimate championship so won five
40:17
championships that's great another team
40:19
won a championship this year team's
40:21
gonna win a championship next year those
40:22
things come and they go but what stays
40:24
is how do you use your passion and use
40:27
that to inspire somebody else to create
40:29
their passion and then how can they pass
40:32
that on to the next person that is true
40:35
success so my goals have changed
40:38
drastically from the time I was 6 years
40:39
old to the time I was 17 at the time I
40:41
was 25 and now senior at 37 so now you
40:47
left the game of basketball we're here
40:48
in Shanghai we're gonna end our talk
40:51
today because we've gone a little bit
40:53
past our limit but I think everybody is
40:54
very happy to be here and I think they
40:56
learned a lot about the memoy Mamba
40:58
mentality right what's what's next you
41:02
know for you well it's it's always
41:04
teaching the game my teaching the game
41:06
through various ways you know it's we do
41:09
camps and clinics we do those things and
41:11
but also through storytelling right how
41:14
can you how can you share stories with
41:16
the rest of the world that challenges
41:18
them to look internally and and to learn
41:21
things like process and learn how to
41:24
navigate the sense of self and all these
41:25
things how can you infuse that and to
41:27
entertainment in a way that pushes our
41:30
culture and our society forward now
41:32
those are the questions and I'm really
41:33
really intrigued by that's what we'll
41:35
focus on ladies and gentlemen one of the
41:37
greatest of all time Kobe Bryant
41:41
